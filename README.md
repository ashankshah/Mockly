## 🌟 Why Mockly?  
While coding prep has been standardized by platforms like LeetCode, behavioral prep has stayed broken. Companies such as Meta and others are placing increasing emphasis on communication and confidence during interviews.  

Mockly is our fix: a platform that makes behavioral prep measurable, repeatable, and effective.
